# Bank-Customer-Churn-Data-Analysis

The Bank Customer Churn Analysis project in Power BI analyzes four years of data to identify patterns and factors
 contributing to customer churn, including credit score, gender, credit card ownership, location, age, and customer 
activity. By understanding customer behavior, the bank can implement targeted retention strategies to enhance customer 
satisfaction. Measures such as introducing loyalty programs and policies are taken to retain customers. Power BI's visualizations
 and interactive dashboards provide valuable insights into churn rates, customer segments, and key metrics, enabling data-driven
 decision-making for effective customer retention efforts.
